1	Pathobiology of small invasive breast cancers without metastases (T1a/b, N0, M0): National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) protocol B-21.	2007	Uncertainties continue to exist concerning the outcomes and management of small (T1a/b N0 M0) invasive breast cancers. A central pathology review was performed of 638 such lesions from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) clinical trial B-21. Univariate analysis revealed a high risk for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with tumors exhibiting a ductal carcinoma in situ component or poor nuclear grade. The converse (protective effect) was found with tumors arising in radial scars, those of tubular histologic type, and those with moderate/marked tumor stroma. The correlations were generally similar for disease-free survival. However, only nuclear grade was found to be independently significant for both of these outcomes. Only lymphatic tumor extension was univariately and multivariately significant for overall survival. The long-term results of follow-up (median, 11.2 years) from the current trial continue to support the need for local breast irradiation and adjuvant therapy in the management of patients with these small cancers.

2	Eight-year update of a prospective study of wide excision alone for small low- or intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).	2014	Whether wide excision with margins ≥1 cm is sufficient treatment for small low- or intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is unclear. This is an updated analysis of a phase II, single-arm, prospective trial testing this hypothesis. A total of 158 patients with low- or intermediate-grade DCIS who underwent wide excision alone (without radiation or tamoxifen) were entered onto the trial from 1995 to 2002. Entry criteria included mammographic extent ≤2.5 cm, predominantly low or intermediate nuclear grade, and excision with final microscopic margins ≥1 cm. Eight-year minimum potential follow-up was required for inclusion in the analysis; the final population comprised 143 patients. Cumulative incidence curves were generated to assess rates of local recurrence (LR) or other events. Median follow-up time was 11 years. Nineteen patients (13 %) had LR as a first event within 8 years. Thirteen LR (68 %) were DCIS only and six (32 %) were invasive. Fourteen (74 %) occurred in the original quadrant. The 10-year estimated cumulative incidence of LR was 15.6 %. The estimated annual percentage rate of LR was 1.9 % per patient-year. With longer follow-up, there remains a substantial and ongoing risk of LR in patients with favorable DCIS treated with wide excision margins without radiation. This information should be useful as patients and clinicians weigh the options of wide excision with and without radiation.

3	Choosing treatment for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ: fine tuning the University of Southern California/Van Nuys Prognostic Index.	2011	The University of Southern California/Van Nuys Prognostic Index is an algorithm that quantifies five measurable prognostic factors known to be important in predicting local recurrence in conservatively treated patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (tumor size, margin width, nuclear grade, age, and comedonecrosis). With three times as many patients since originally developed, sufficient numbers now exist for analysis by individual scores rather than groups of scores. To achieve a local recurrence rate of less than 20% at 12 years, these data support excision alone for all patients scoring 4, 5, or 6 and patients who score 7 but have margin widths ≥ 3 mm. Excision plus RT achieves the less than 20% local recurrence requirement at 12 years for patients who score 7 and have margins < 3 mm, patients who score 8 and have margins ≥ 3 mm, and for patients who score 9 and have margins ≥ 5 mm. Mastectomy is required for patients who score 8 and have margins < 3 mm, who score 9 and have margins < 5 mm, and for all patients who score 10, 11, or 12 to keep the local recurrence rate less than 20% at 12 years. These recommendations in this article represent substantial changes from those previously published.

4	Twenty-year follow-up of a randomized trial comparing total mastectomy, lumpectomy, and lumpectomy plus irradiation for the treatment of invasive breast cancer.	2002	In 1976, we initiated a randomized trial to determine whether lumpectomy with or without radiation therapy was as effective as total mastectomy for the treatment of invasive breast cancer. A total of 1851 women for whom follow-up data were available and nodal status was known underwent randomly assigned treatment consisting of total mastectomy, lumpectomy alone, or lumpectomy and breast irradiation. Kaplan-Meier and cumulative-incidence estimates of the outcome were obtained. The cumulative incidence of recurrent tumor in the ipsilateral breast was 14.3 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy and breast irradiation, as compared with 39.2 percent in the women who underwent lumpectomy without irradiation (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed among the three groups of women with respect to disease-free survival, distant-disease-free survival, or overall survival. The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy alone, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 1.05 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.23; P=0.51). The hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation, as compared with those who underwent total mastectomy, was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.14; P=0.74). Among the lumpectomy-treated women whose surgical specimens had tumor-free margins, the hazard ratio for death among the women who underwent postoperative breast irradiation, as compared with those who did not, was 0.91 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.06; P=0.23). Radiation therapy was associated with a marginally significant decrease in deaths due to breast cancer. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deaths from other causes. Lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation continues to be appropriate therapy for women with breast cancer, provided that the margins of resected specimens are free of tumor and an acceptable cosmetic result can be obtained.

15	Lumpectomy plus tamoxifen with or without irradiation in women age 70 years or older with early breast cancer: long-term follow-up of CALGB 9343.	2013	To determine whether there is a benefit to adjuvant radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery and tamoxifen in women age ≥ 70 years with early-stage breast cancer. Between July 1994 and February 1999, 636 women (age ≥ 70 years) who had clinical stage I (T1N0M0 according to TNM classification) estrogen receptor (ER) -positive breast carcinoma treated by lumpectomy were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen plus radiation therapy (TamRT; 317 women) or tamoxifen alone (Tam; 319 women). Primary end points were time to local or regional recurrence, frequency of mastectomy, breast cancer-specific survival, time to distant metastasis, and overall survival (OS). Median follow-up for treated patients is now 12.6 years. At 10 years, 98% of patients receiving TamRT (95% CI, 96% to 99%) compared with 90% of those receiving Tam (95% CI, 85% to 93%) were free from local and regional recurrences. There were no significant differences in time to mastectomy, time to distant metastasis, breast cancer-specific survival, or OS between the two groups. Ten-year OS was 67% (95% CI, 62% to 72%) and 66% (95% CI, 61% to 71%) in the TamRT and Tam groups, respectively. With long-term follow-up, the previously observed small improvement in locoregional recurrence with the addition of radiation therapy remains. However, this does not translate into an advantage in OS, distant disease-free survival, or breast preservation. Depending on the value placed on local recurrence, Tam remains a reasonable option for women age ≥ 70 years with ER-positive early-stage breast cancer.

5	Long-term outcomes of invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences after lumpectomy in NSABP B-17 and B-24 randomized clinical trials for DCIS.	2011	Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) is the most common failure event after lumpectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We evaluated invasive IBTR (I-IBTR) and its influence on survival among participants in two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) randomized trials for DCIS. In the NSABP B-17 trial (accrual period: October 1, 1985, to December 31, 1990), patients with localized DCIS were randomly assigned to the lumpectomy only (LO, n = 403) group or to the lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy (LRT, n = 410) group. In the NSABP B-24 double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (accrual period: May 9, 1991, to April 13, 1994), all accrued patients were randomly assigned to LRT+ placebo, (n=900) or LRT + tamoxifen (LRT + TAM, n = 899). Endpoints included I-IBTR, DCIS-IBTR, contralateral breast cancers (CBC), overall and breast cancer-specific survival, and survival after I-IBTR. Median follow-up was 207 months for the B-17 trial (N = 813 patients) and 163 months for the B-24 trial (N = 1799 patients). Of 490 IBTR events, 263 (53.7%) were invasive. Radiation reduced I-IBTR by 52% in the LRT group compared with LO (B-17, hazard ratio [HR] of risk of I-IBTR = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33 to 0.69, P < .001). LRT + TAM reduced I-IBTR by 32% compared with LRT + placebo (B-24, HR of risk of I-IBTR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.95, P = .025). The 15-year cumulative incidence of I-IBTR was 19.4% for LO, 8.9% for LRT (B-17), 10.0% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 8.5% for LRT + TAM. The 15-year cumulative incidence of all contralateral breast cancers was 10.3% for LO, 10.2% for LRT (B-17), 10.8% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 7.3% for LRT + TAM. I-IBTR was associated with increased mortality risk (HR of death = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.45 to 2.96, P < .001), whereas recurrence of DCIS was not. Twenty-two of 39 deaths after I-IBTR were attributed to breast cancer. Among all patients (with or without I-IBTR), the 15-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer death was 3.1% for LO, 4.7% for LRT (B-17), 2.7% for LRT + placebo (B-24), and 2.3% for LRT + TAM. Although I-IBTR increased the risk for breast cancer-related death, radiation therapy and tamoxifen reduced I-IBTR, and long-term prognosis remained excellent after breast-conserving surgery for DCIS.

6	Effect of tamoxifen and radiotherapy in women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ: long-term results from the UK/ANZ DCIS trial.	2011	Initial results of the UK/ANZ DCIS (UK, Australia, and New Zealand ductal carcinoma in situ) trial suggested that radiotherapy reduced new breast events of ipsilateral invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) compared with no radiotherapy, but no significant effects were noted with tamoxifen. Here, we report long-term results of this trial. Women with completely locally excised DCIS were recruited into a randomised 2×2 factorial trial of radiotherapy, tamoxifen, or both. Randomisation was independently done for each of the two treatments (radiotherapy and tamoxifen), stratified by screening assessment centre, and blocked in groups of four. The recommended dose for radiation was 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (2 Gy per day on weekdays), and tamoxifen was prescribed at a dose of 20 mg daily for 5 years. Elective decision to withhold or provide one of the treatments was permitted. The endpoints of primary interest were invasive ipsilateral new breast events for the radiotherapy comparison and any new breast event, including contralateral disease and DCIS, for tamoxifen. Analysis of each of the two treatment comparisons was restricted to patients who were randomly assigned to that treatment. Analyses were by intention to treat. All trial drugs have been completed and this study is in long-term follow-up. This study is registered, number ISRCTN99513870. Between May, 1990, and August, 1998, 1701 women were randomly assigned to radiotherapy and tamoxifen, radiotherapy alone, tamoxifen alone, or to no adjuvant treatment. Seven patients had protocol violations and thus 1694 patients were available for analysis. After a median follow-up of 12·7 years (IQR 10·9-14·7), 376 (163 invasive [122 ipsilateral vs 39 contralateral], 197 DCIS [174 ipsilateral vs 17 contralateral], and 16 of unknown invasiveness or laterality) breast cancers were diagnosed. Radiotherapy reduced the incidence of all new breast events (hazard ratio [HR] 0·41, 95% CI 0·30-0·56; p<0·0001), reducing the incidence of ipsilateral invasive disease (0·32, 0·19-0·56; p<0·0001) as well as ipsilateral DCIS (0·38, 0·22-0·63; p<0·0001), but having no effect on contralateral breast cancer (0·84, 0·45-1·58; p=0·6). Tamoxifen reduced the incidence of all new breast events (HR 0·71, 95% CI 0·58-0·88; p=0·002), reducing recurrent ipsilateral DCIS (0·70, 0·51-0·86; p=0·03) and contralateral tumours (0·44, 0·25-0·77; p=0·005), but having no effect on ipsilateral invasive disease (0·95, 0·66-1·38; p=0·8). No data on adverse events except cause of death were collected for this trial. This updated analysis confirms the long-term beneficial effect of radiotherapy and reports a benefit for tamoxifen in reducing local and contralateral new breast events for women with DCIS treated by complete local excision.

7	Long-term results of a randomized trial comparing breast-conserving therapy with mastectomy: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 10801 trial.	2000	Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) has been shown to be as effective as mastectomy in the treatment of tumors 2 cm or smaller. However, evidence of its efficacy, over the long term, in patients with tumors larger than 2 cm is limited. From May 1980 to May 1986, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer carried out a randomized, multicenter trial comparing BCT with modified radical mastectomy for patients with tumors up to 5 cm. In this analysis, we investigated whether the treatments resulted in different overall survival, time to distant metastasis, or time to locoregional recurrence. Of 868 eligible breast cancer patients randomly assigned to the BCT arm or to the modified radical mastectomy arm, 80% had a tumor of 2.1-5 cm. BCT comprised lumpectomy with an attempted margin of 1 cm of healthy tissue and complete axillary clearance, followed by radiotherapy to the breast and a supplementary dose to the tumor bed. The median follow-up was 13.4 years. All P values are two-sided. At 10 years, there was no difference between the two groups in overall survival (66% for the mastectomy patients and 65% for the BCT patients; P =.11) or in their distant metastasis-free rates (66% for the mastectomy patients and 61% for the BCT patients; P =.24). The rate of locoregional recurrence (occurring before or at the same time as distant metastasis) at 10 years did show a statistically significant difference (12% of the mastectomy and 20% of the BCT patients; P =. 01). BCT and mastectomy demonstrate similar survival rates in a trial in which the great majority of the patients had stage II breast cancer.	van Dongen JA, Voogd AC, Fentiman IS, Legrand C, Sylvester RJ, Tong D, van der Schueren E, Helle PA, van Zijl K, Bartelink H	10904087	10.1093/jnci/92.14.1143	["29434661", "28948195", "12160123", "28099081", "22996169", "27559956", "29624915", "30043339", "17931406", "25083471", "21134651", "27051315", "29761001", "15798465", "26257408", "20673353", "30687634", "16430776", "29302485", "25245129", "27777879", "27013323", "29873061", "22337687", "25909011", "25866810", "23843852", "25898339", "27756882", "24367188", "25203877", "27453779", "29132568", "26855903", "30127671", "28320428", "28831358", "22270108", "24377002", "21559024", "19356240", "26600997", "30957062", "21673870", "21209588", "23061042", "30687630", "29719816", "27500636", "21029281", "26657655", "24311961", "24614128", "22621334", "25608599", "29069026", "26770246", "20089167", "23237221", "24423978", "25902343", "20171811", "28560329", "25267503", "20376555", "21418616", "26430477", "19636020", "28938661", "28831273", "25113764", "25956579", "30882711", "25587453", "22723919", "24940101", "14727779", "23091733", "25022995", "25799220", "25114857", "21935314", "30915240", "30343456", "25672561", "25879025", "29986654", "23622020", "21553117", "24473640", "20152772", "19720914", "28705082", "22928097", "25083429", "23346171", "27425375", "27403017", "28740889", "26218994", "22520579", "22516344", "27401651", "12496527", "29250179", "27162648", "22750902", "26479066", "30607122", "27180041", "21847394", "28292293", "30100074", "25098247", "28690654", "29456470", "21964004", "16013621", "17069664", "25013439", "29516372", "24377012", "23213495", "25097562", "19678927", "21900114", "30175053", "30839601", "20579123", "21844847", "15611797", "27588192", "23291658", "19609829", "29876182", "29721469", "21699739", "29315233", "27514645", "30581581", "25001868", "30948876", "27242967", "21750129", "26752928", "24376983", "24734939", "15960690", "20549566", "30328620", "27648567", "25228818", "24746949", "22279416", "27164854", "28469511", "27906044", "20564117", "25743325", "25036472", "26217111", "29582632", "27175630", "19800468", "22323915", "28975837", "21947595", "26313374", "28454215", "28831438", "24116160", "21504577", "25893416", "25517451", "23133105"]	[]	2	["Breast", "Neoplasms"]
8	Breast-conserving treatment with or without radiotherapy in ductal carcinoma-in-situ: ten-year results of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer randomized phase III trial 10853--a study by the EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group and EORTC Radiotherapy Group.	2006	The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer conducted a randomized trial investigating the role of radiotherapy (RT) after local excision (LE) of ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) of the breast. We analyzed the efficacy of RT with 10 years follow-up on both the overall risk of local recurrence (LR) and related to clinical, histologic, and treatment factors. After complete LE, women with DCIS were randomly assigned to no further treatment or RT (50 Gy). One thousand ten women with mostly (71%) mammographically detected DCIS were included. The median follow-up was 10.5 years. The 10-year LR-free rate was 74% in the group treated with LE alone compared with 85% in the women treated by LE plus RT (log-rank P < .0001; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53). The risk of DCIS and invasive LR was reduced by 48% (P = .0011) and 42% (P = .0065) respectively. Both groups had similar low risks of metastases and death. At multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with an increased LR risk were young age (< or = 40 years; HR = 1.89), symptomatic detection (HR = 1.55), intermediately or poorly differentiated DCIS (as opposed to well-differentiated DCIS; HR = 1.85 and HR = 1.61 respectively), cribriform or solid growth pattern (as opposed to clinging/micropapillary subtypes; HR = 2.39 and HR = 2.25 respectively), doubtful margins (HR = 1.84), and treatment by LE alone (HR = 1.82). The effect of RT was homogeneous across all assessed risk factors. With long-term follow-up, RT after LE for DCIS continued to reduce the risk of LR, with a 47% reduction at 10 years. All patient subgroups benefited from RT.

16	Surgical Excision Without Radiation for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ of the Breast: 12-Year Results From the ECOG-ACRIN E5194 Study.	2016	To determine the 12-year risk of developing an ipsilateral breast event (IBE) for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast treated with surgical excision (lumpectomy) without radiation. A prospective clinical trial was performed for women with DCIS who were selected for low-risk clinical and pathologic characteristics. Patients were enrolled onto one of two study cohorts (not randomly assigned): cohort 1: low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, tumor size 2.5 cm or smaller (n = 561); or cohort 2: high-grade DCIS, tumor size 1 cm or smaller (n = 104). Protocol specifications included excision of the DCIS tumor with a minimum negative margin width of at least 3 mm. Tamoxifen (not randomly assigned) was given to 30% of the patients. An IBE was defined as local recurrence of DCIS or invasive carcinoma in the treated breast. Median follow-up time was 12.3 years. There were 99 IBEs, of which 51 (52%) were invasive. The IBE and invasive IBE rates increased over time in both cohorts. The 12-year rates of developing an IBE were 14.4% for cohort 1 and 24.6% for cohort 2 (P = .003). The 12-year rates of developing an invasive IBE were 7.5% and 13.4%, respectively (P = .08). On multivariable analysis, study cohort and tumor size were both significantly associated with developing an IBE (P = .009 and P = .03, respectively). For patients with DCIS selected for favorable clinical and pathologic characteristics and treated with excision without radiation, the risks of developing an IBE and an invasive IBE increased through 12 years of follow-up, without plateau. These data help inform the treatment decision-making process for patients and their physicians.

9	Twenty-year follow-up of a randomized study comparing breast-conserving surgery with radical mastectomy for early breast cancer.	2002	We conducted 20 years of follow-up of women enrolled in a randomized trial to compare the efficacy of radical (Halsted) mastectomy with that of breast-conserving surgery. From 1973 to 1980, 701 women with breast cancers measuring no more than 2 cm in diameter were randomly assigned to undergo radical mastectomy (349 patients) or breast-conserving surgery (quadrantectomy) followed by radiotherapy to the ipsilateral mammary tissue (352 patients). After 1976, patients in both groups who had positive axillary nodes also received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Thirty women in the group that underwent breast-conserving therapy had a recurrence of tumor in the same breast, whereas eight women in the radical-mastectomy group had local recurrences (P<0.001). The crude cumulative incidence of these events was 8.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, after 20 years. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rates of contralateral-breast carcinomas, distant metastases, or second primary cancers. After a median follow-up of 20 years, the rate of death from all causes was 41.7 percent in the group that underwent breast-conserving surgery and 41.2 percent in the radical-mastectomy group (P=1.0). The respective rates of death from breast cancer were 26.1 percent and 24.3 percent (P=0.8). The long-term survival rate among women who undergo breast-conserving surgery is the same as that among women who undergo radical mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery is therefore the treatment of choice for women with relatively small breast cancers.

10	Effect of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery on 10-year recurrence and 15-year breast cancer death: meta-analysis of individual patient data for 10,801 women in 17 randomised trials.	2011	After breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy reduces recurrence and breast cancer death, but it may do so more for some groups of women than for others. We describe the absolute magnitude of these reductions according to various prognostic and other patient characteristics, and relate the absolute reduction in 15-year risk of breast cancer death to the absolute reduction in 10-year recurrence risk. We undertook a meta-analysis of individual patient data for 10,801 women in 17 randomised trials of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, 8337 of whom had pathologically confirmed node-negative (pN0) or node-positive (pN+) disease. Overall, radiotherapy reduced the 10-year risk of any (ie, locoregional or distant) first recurrence from 35·0% to 19·3% (absolute reduction 15·7%, 95% CI 13·7-17·7, 2p<0·00001) and reduced the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 25·2% to 21·4% (absolute reduction 3·8%, 1·6-6·0, 2p=0·00005). In women with pN0 disease (n=7287), radiotherapy reduced these risks from 31·0% to 15·6% (absolute recurrence reduction 15·4%, 13·2-17·6, 2p<0·00001) and from 20·5% to 17·2% (absolute mortality reduction 3·3%, 0·8-5·8, 2p=0·005), respectively. In these women with pN0 disease, the absolute recurrence reduction varied according to age, grade, oestrogen-receptor status, tamoxifen use, and extent of surgery, and these characteristics were used to predict large (≥20%), intermediate (10-19%), or lower (<10%) absolute reductions in the 10-year recurrence risk. Absolute reductions in 15-year risk of breast cancer death in these three prediction categories were 7·8% (95% CI 3·1-12·5), 1·1% (-2·0 to 4·2), and 0·1% (-7·5 to 7·7) respectively (trend in absolute mortality reduction 2p=0·03). In the few women with pN+ disease (n=1050), radiotherapy reduced the 10-year recurrence risk from 63·7% to 42·5% (absolute reduction 21·2%, 95% CI 14·5-27·9, 2p<0·00001) and the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 51·3% to 42·8% (absolute reduction 8·5%, 1·8-15·2, 2p=0·01). Overall, about one breast cancer death was avoided by year 15 for every four recurrences avoided by year 10, and the mortality reduction did not differ significantly from this overall relationship in any of the three prediction categories for pN0 disease or for pN+ disease. After breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy to the conserved breast halves the rate at which the disease recurs and reduces the breast cancer death rate by about a sixth. These proportional benefits vary little between different groups of women. By contrast, the absolute benefits from radiotherapy vary substantially according to the characteristics of the patient and they can be predicted at the time when treatment decisions need to be made.

11	Effect of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ: 20 years follow-up in the randomized SweDCIS Trial.	2015	Four randomized studies show that adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) lowers the risk of subsequent ipsilateral breast events (IBEs) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by approximately 50% after 10 to 15 years. We present 20 years of follow-up data for the SweDCIS trial. Between 1987 and 1999 1,046 women were randomly assigned to RT or not after BCS for primary DCIS. Results up to 2005 have been published, and we now add another 7 years of follow-up. All breast cancer events and causes of death were registered. There were 129 in situ and 129 invasive IBEs. Absolute risk reduction in the RT arm was 12.0% at 20 years (95% CI, 6.5 to 17.7), with a relative risk reduction of 37.5%. Absolute reduction was 10.0% (95% CI, 6.0 to 14.0) for in situ and 2.0% (95% CI, -3.0 to 7.0) for invasive IBEs. There was a nonstatistically significantly increased number of contralateral events in the RT arm (67 v 48 events; hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.00). Breast cancer-specific death and overall survival were not influenced. Younger women experienced a relatively higher risk of invasive IBE and lower effect of RT. The hazard over time looked different for in situ and invasive IBEs. Use of adjuvant RT is supported by 20-year follow-up. Modest protection against invasive recurrences and a possible increase in contralateral cancers still call for a need to find groups of patients for whom RT could be avoided or mastectomy with breast reconstruction is indicated.

12	A multigene expression assay to predict local recurrence risk for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.	2013	For women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, the risk of developing an ipsilateral breast event (IBE; defined as local recurrence of DCIS or invasive carcinoma) after surgical excision without radiation is not well defined by clinical and pathologic characteristics. The Oncotype DX breast cancer assay was performed for patients with DCIS treated with surgical excision without radiation in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E5194 study. The association of the prospectively defined DCIS Score (calculated from seven cancer-related genes and five reference genes) with the risk of developing an IBE was analyzed using Cox regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. There were 327 patients with adequate tissue for analysis. The continuous DCIS Score was statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing an IBE (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 4.49; P = .02) when adjusted for tamoxifen use (prespecified primary analysis) and with invasive IBE (unadjusted HR = 3.68, 95% CI = 1.34 to 9.62; P = .01). For the prespecified DCIS risk groups of low, intermediate, and high, the 10-year risks of developing an IBE were 10.6%, 26.7%, and 25.9%, respectively, and for an invasive IBE, 3.7%, 12.3%, and 19.2%, respectively (both log rank P ≤ .006). In multivariable analyses, factors associated with IBE risk were DCIS Score, tumor size, and menopausal status (all P ≤ .02). The DCIS Score quantifies IBE risk and invasive IBE risk, complements traditional clinical and pathologic factors, and provides a new clinical tool to improve selecting individualized treatment for women with DCIS who meet the ECOG E5194 criteria.

13	RTOG 9804: a prospective randomized trial for good-risk ductal carcinoma in situ comparing radiotherapy with observation.	2015	The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9804 study identified good-risk patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a breast cancer diagnosis found frequently in mammographically detected cancers, to test the benefit of radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery compared with observation. This prospective randomized trial (1998 to 2006) in women with mammographically detected low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, measuring less than 2.5 cm with margins ≥ 3 mm, compared RT with observation after surgery. The study was designed for 1,790 patients but was closed early because of lower than projected accrual. Six hundred thirty-six patients from the United States and Canada were entered; tamoxifen use (62%) was optional. Ipsilateral local failure (LF) was the primary end point; LF and contralateral failure were estimated using cumulative incidence, and overall and disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median follow-up time was 7.17 years (range, 0.01 to 11.33 years). Two LFs occurred in the RT arm, and 19 occurred in the observation arm. At 7 years, the LF rate was 0.9% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.2%) in the RT arm versus 6.7% (95% CI, 3.2% to 9.6%) in the observation arm (hazard ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.47; P < .001). Grade 1 to 2 acute toxicities occurred in 30% and 76% of patients in the observation and RT arms, respectively; grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in 4.0% and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Late RT toxicity was grade 1 in 30%, grade 2 in 4.6%, and grade 3 in 0.7% of patients. In this good-risk subset of patients with DCIS, with a median follow-up of 7 years, the LF rate was low with observation but was decreased significantly with the addition of RT. Longer follow-up is planned because the timeline for LF in this setting seems protracted.

14	Breast-conserving surgery with or without irradiation in women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer (PRIME II): a randomised controlled trial.	2015	For most older women with early breast cancer, standard treatment after breast-conserving surgery is adjuvant whole-breast radiotherapy and adjuvant endocrine treatment. We aimed to assess the effect omission of whole-breast radiotherapy would have on local control in older women at low risk of local recurrence at 5 years. Between April 16, 2003, and Dec 22, 2009, 1326 women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer judged low-risk (ie, hormone receptor-positive, axillary node-negative, T1-T2 up to 3 cm at the longest dimension, and clear margins; grade 3 tumour histology or lymphovascular invasion, but not both, were permitted), who had had breast-conserving surgery and were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment, were recruited into a phase 3 randomised controlled trial at 76 centres in four countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either whole-breast radiotherapy (40-50 Gy in 15-25 fractions) or no radiotherapy by computer-generated permuted block randomisation, stratified by centre, with a block size of four. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence. Follow-up continues and will end at the 10-year anniversary of the last randomised patient. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is registered on ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN95889329. 658 women who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and who were receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast irradiation and 668 were allocated to no further treatment. After median follow-up of 5 years (IQR 3·84-6·05), ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was 1·3% (95% CI 0·2-2·3; n=5) in women assigned to whole-breast radiotherapy and 4·1% (2·4-5·7; n=26) in those assigned no radiotherapy (p=0·0002). Compared with women allocated to whole-breast radiotherapy, the univariate hazard ratio for ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence in women assigned to no radiotherapy was 5·19 (95% CI 1·99-13·52; p=0·0007). No differences in regional recurrence, distant metastases, contralateral breast cancers, or new breast cancers were noted between groups. 5-year overall survival was 93·9% (95% CI 91·8-96·0) in both groups (p=0·34). 89 women died; eight of 49 patients allocated to no radiotherapy and four of 40 assigned to radiotherapy died from breast cancer. Postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant endocrine treatment resulted in a significant but modest reduction in local recurrence for women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer 5 years after randomisation. However, the 5-year rate of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence is probably low enough for omission of radiotherapy to be considered for some patients.

17	Nomogram for predicting the risk of local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ.	2010	While the mortality associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is minimal, the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is relatively high. Radiation therapy (RT) and antiestrogen agents reduce the risk of IBTR and are considered standard treatment options after BCS. However, they have never been proven to improve survival, and in themselves carry rare but serious risks. Individualized estimation of IBTR risk would assist in decision making regarding the various treatment options for women with DCIS. From 1991 to 2006, 1,868 consecutive patients treated with BCS for DCIS were identified. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was constructed using the 1,681 in whom data were complete. Ten clinical, pathologic, and treatment variables were built into a nomogram estimating probability of IBTR at 5 and 10 years after BCS. The model was validated for discrimination and calibration using bootstrap resampling. The DCIS nomogram for prediction of 5- and 10-year IBTR probabilities demonstrated good calibration and discrimination, with a concordance index of 0.704 (bootstrap corrected, 0.688) and a concordance probability estimate of 0.686. Factors with the greatest influence on risk of IBTR in the model included adjuvant RT or endocrine therapy, age, margin status, number of excisions, and treatment time period. The DCIS nomogram integrates 10 clinicopathologic variables to provide an individualized risk estimate of IBTR in a woman with DCIS treated with BCS. This tool may assist in individual decision making regarding various treatment options and help avoid over- and undertreatment of noninvasive breast cancer.

18	Dose selection in stereotactic radiosurgery.	2013	Selection of the prescription dose for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) radiosurgery is the final step in treatment planning. Physicians need to choose a prescription dose that provides an optimal middle ground between optimizing AVM obliteration with high radiation doses and limiting complication risks with the lowest doses. Accurately predicting complication risks for individual patients is a complex process that is highly dependent on the radiosurgery treatment volume, the target location and the nature of the target tissue. This article reviews the principles and data guiding dose selection for AVM radiosurgery.

19	Long-term outcomes of vestibular schwannomas treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy: an institutional experience.	2011	We assessed clinical outcome and long-term tumor control after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) for unilateral schwannoma. Between 1995 and 2007, 496 patients were treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy at Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD); 385 patients had radiologic follow-up that met the inclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was treatment failure. Secondary endpoints were radiologic progression and clinical outcome. Logistic regression analysis assessed the association of age, race, tumor side, sex, and pretreatment symptoms. In 11 patients (3%) treatment failed, and they required salvage (microsurgical) treatment. Radiologic progression was observed in 116 patients (30.0%), including 35 patients (9%) in whom the treatment volume more than doubled during the follow-up period, although none required surgical resection. Tumors with baseline volumes of less than 1 cm(3) were 18.02 times more likely to progress than those with tumor volumes of 1 cm(3) or greater (odds ratio, 18.02; 95% confidence interval, 4.25-76.32). Treatment-induced neurologic morbidity included 8 patients (1.6%) with new facial weakness, 12 patients (2.8%) with new trigeminal paresthesias, 4 patients (0.9%) with hydrocephalus (1 communicating and 3 obstructive), and 2 patients (0.5%) with possibly radiation-induced neoplasia. Although the rate of treatment failure is low (3%), careful follow-up shows that radiologic progression occurs frequently. When reporting outcome, the "no salvage surgery needed" and "no additional treatment needed" criteria for treatment success need to be complemented by the radiologic data.

20	Conservative management of 386 cases of unilateral vestibular schwannoma: tumor growth and consequences for treatment.	2009	The object of this study was to evaluate the natural history, pattern, and occurrence of tumor growth and its consequences for treatment of small-sized vestibular schwannomas (VSs). From 1990 to 2005, 386 patients underwent conservative management for VS because of the following: age > 60 years, poor health/medical risks, risk of deterioration of good hearing, small tumor size, minimal or no incapacitating symptoms, and/or patient preference. Tumor size was measured by MR imaging according to the guidelines of the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium. The first MR imaging study was performed 1 year after diagnosis, and subsequent imaging was performed yearly or every 2 years depending on the appearance of new symptoms, tumor growth, or both. Sixty-one patients were lost to follow-up the first year after presentation. Of the 325 patients for whom 1-year follow-up data were available, 39 showed tumor growth > or = 3 mm. Conservative management was discontinued for these 39 patients. The patients who returned for follow-up were evaluated at 1- or 2-year intervals depending on tumor growth. The authors extrapolated to obtain data for 2-year intervals, yielding data for 160, 56, 21, and 8 patients at 3, 5, 7, and 9 years after initial presentation, respectively. The overall mean tumor growth rate (+/-standard deviation) was 1.15 +/- 2.4 mm/year. This rate was estimated by pooling all values of tumor growth that had been determined for all patients and dividing by the total number of "events," with each assessment constituting an event. In 58.6% of patients, the annual tumor growth rate was < 1 mm/year; in 29.2%, 1-3 mm/year; and in 12.2%, > or = 3 mm/ year. The growth rates of intrameatal (1.02 +/- 1.8 mm/year) and extrameatal (1.40 +/- 3.1 mm/year) tumors did not differ significantly. No significant association was found between tumor growth rate and sex, age, initial hearing status, or initial tumor grade. Delay in diagnosis was the only significant factor associated with tumor growth rate. During follow-up, conservative management was discontinued for 77 (23.7%) of the 325 patients for whom at least 12-month follow-up data were available; surgery was performed in 60 (77.9%) and radiation therapy in 17 (22.1%). The results of this study support the role of a conservative "wait-and-scan" policy of management for small-sized VSs because most have a slow growth rate. Long-term neuroimaging follow-up is needed even with non-growing tumors.

21	Gamma knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: outcomes and prognostic factors.	2005	Microvascular decompression (MVD) and percutaneous ablation surgery have historically been the treatments of choice for medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Gamma knife surgery (GKS) has been used as an alternative, minimally invasive treatment in TN. In the present study, the authors evaluated the long-term results of GKS in the treatment of TN. From 1996 to 2003, 151 cases of TN were treated with GKS. In this group, radiosurgery was performed once in 136 patients, twice in 14 patients, and three times in one patient. The types of TN were as follows: 122 patients with typical TN, three with atypical TN, four with multiple sclerosis-associated TN, and seven with TN and a history of a cavernous sinus tumor. In each case, the chosen radiosurgical target was located 2 to 4 mm anterior to the entry of the trigeminal nerve into the pons. The maximal radiation doses ranged from 50 to 90 Gy. The median age of the patients was 68 years (range 22-90 years), and the median time from diagnosis to GKS was 72 months (range 1-276 months). The median follow up was 19 months (range 2-96 months). Clinical outcomes and postradiosurgical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate factors that correlated with a favorable, pain-free outcome. The mean time to relief of pain was 24 days (range 1-180 days). Forty-seven, 45, and 34% of patients were pain free without medication at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow ups, respectively. Ninety, 77, and 70% of patients experienced some improvement in pain at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow ups, respectively. Thirty-three (27%) of 122 patients with initial improvement subsequently experienced pain recurrence a median of 12 months (range 2-34 months) post-GKS. Among those whose symptoms recurred, 14 patients underwent additional GKS, six MVD, four glycerol injection, and one patient a percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy. Twelve patients (9%) suffered the onset of new facial numbness post-GKS. Changes on MR images post-GKS were noted in nine patients (7%). On univariate analysis, right-sided neuralgia (p = 0.0002) and a previous neurectomy (p = 0.04) correlated with a pain-free outcome; on multivariate analysis, both rightsided neuralgia (p = 0.032) and patient age (p = 0.05) were statistically significant. New onset of facial numbness following GKS correlated with undergoing more than one GKS (p = 0.002). At the last follow up, GKS effected pain relief in 44% of patients. Some degree of pain improvement at 3 years post-GKS was noted in 70% of patients with TN. Although less effective than MVD, GKS remains a reasonable treatment option for those unwilling or unable to undergo more invasive surgical approaches and offers a low risk of side effects.

22	Medical management with or without interventional therapy for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA): a multicentre, non-blinded, randomised trial.	2014	The clinical benefit of preventive eradication of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations remains uncertain. A Randomised trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA) aims to compare the risk of death and symptomatic stroke in patients with an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation who are allocated to either medical management alone or medical management with interventional therapy. Adult patients (≥18 years) with an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation were enrolled into this trial at 39 clinical sites in nine countries. Patients were randomised (by web-based system, in a 1:1 ratio, with random permuted block design [block size 2, 4, or 6], stratified by clinical site) to medical management with interventional therapy (ie, neurosurgery, embolisation, or stereotactic radiotherapy, alone or in combination) or medical management alone (ie, pharmacological therapy for neurological symptoms as needed). Patients, clinicians, and investigators are aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome is time to the composite endpoint of death or symptomatic stroke; the primary analysis is by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00389181. Randomisation was started on April 4, 2007, and was stopped on April 15, 2013, when a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health recommended halting randomisation because of superiority of the medical management group (log-rank Z statistic of 4·10, exceeding the prespecified stopping boundary value of 2·87). At this point, outcome data were available for 223 patients (mean follow-up 33·3 months [SD 19·7]), 114 assigned to interventional therapy and 109 to medical management. The primary endpoint had been reached by 11 (10·1%) patients in the medical management group compared with 35 (30·7%) in the interventional therapy group. The risk of death or stroke was significantly lower in the medical management group than in the interventional therapy group (hazard ratio 0·27, 95% CI 0·14-0·54). No harms were identified, other than a higher number of strokes (45 vs 12, p<0·0001) and neurological deficits unrelated to stroke (14 vs 1, p=0·0008) in patients allocated to interventional therapy compared with medical management. The ARUBA trial showed that medical management alone is superior to medical management with interventional therapy for the prevention of death or stroke in patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations followed up for 33 months. The trial is continuing its observational phase to establish whether the disparities will persist over an additional 5 years of follow-up.

23	Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas.	1998	Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented. We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing. The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases. Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.

24	Management of 1000 vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas): surgical management and results with an emphasis on complications and how to avoid them.	1997	To identify the actual benefits and persisting problems in treating vestibular schwannomas by the suboccipital approach, the results and complications in a consecutive series of 1000 tumors surgically treated by the senior author were analyzed and compared with experiences involving other treatment modalities. Pre- and postoperative clinical statuses were determined and radiological and surgical findings were collected and evaluated in a large database for 962 patients undergoing 1000 vestibular schwannoma operations at Nordstadt's neurosurgical department from 1978 to 1993. By the suboccipital transmeatal approach, 979 tumors were completely removed; in 21 cases, deliberate partial removal was performed either in severely ill patients for decompression of the brain stem or in an attempt to preserve hearing in the last hearing ear. Anatomic preservation of the facial nerve was achieved in 93% of the patients and of the cochlear nerve in 68%. Major neurological complications included 1 case of tetraparesis, 10 cases of hemiparesis, and caudal cranial nerve palsies in 5.5% of the cases. Surgical complications included hematomas in 2.2% of the cases, cerebrospinal fluid fistulas in 9.2%, hydrocephalus in 2.3%, bacterial meningitis in 1.2%, and wound revisions in 1.1%. There were 11 deaths occurring at 2 to 69 days postoperatively (1.1%). The techniques that were developed for avoidance of complications are reported. The analysis identifies preexisting severe general and/or neurological morbidity, cystic tumor formation, and major caudal cranial nerve deficits as relevant risk factors. The current treatment options of complete tumor resection with ongoing reduction of morbidity are well fulfilled by the suboccipital approach. By careful patient selection, the mortality rate should be further reduced to below 1%.

25	The risk of hemorrhage after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations.	2005	Angiography shows that stereotactic radiosurgery obliterates most cerebral arteriovenous malformations after a latency period of a few years. However, the effect of this procedure on the risk of hemorrhage is poorly understood. We performed a retrospective observational study of 500 patients with malformations who were treated with radiosurgery with use of a gamma knife. The rates of hemorrhage were assessed during three periods: before radiosurgery, between radiosurgery and the angiographic documentation of obliteration of the malformation (latency period), and after angiographic obliteration. Forty-two hemorrhages were documented before radiosurgery (median follow-up, 0.4 year), 23 during the latency period (median follow-up, 2.0 years), and 6 after obliteration (median follow-up, 5.4 years). As compared with the period between diagnosis and radiosurgery, the risk of hemorrhage decreased by 54 percent during the latency period (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.80; P=0.006) and by 88 percent after obliteration (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.29; P<0.001). The risk was significantly reduced during the period after obliteration, as compared with the latency period (hazard ratio, 0.26; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.68; P=0.006). The reduction was greater among patients who presented with hemorrhage than among those without hemorrhage at presentation and similar in analyses that took into account the delay in confirming obliteration by means of angiography and analyses that excluded data obtained during the first year after diagnosis. Radiosurgery significantly decreases the risk of hemorrhage in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations, even before there is angiographic evidence of obliteration. The risk of hemorrhage is further reduced, although not eliminated, after obliteration.

26	Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies.	2008	Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of facial pain. To answer the following questions: 1) In patients with TN, how often does routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) identify a cause? 2) Which features identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic TN (STN; i.e., a structural cause such as a tumor)? 3) Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify patients with neurovascular compression? 4) Which drugs effectively treat classic and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia? 5) When should surgery be offered? 6) Which surgical technique gives the longest pain-free period with the fewest complications and good quality of life? Systematic review of the literature by a panel of experts. In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with MS remains uncertain.

27	Impact of postoperative radiation therapy on survival in patients with complete resection and stage I, II, or IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: the adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association (ANITA) Randomized Trial.	2008	To study the impact of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) on survival in the Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association (ANITA) randomized study of adjuvant chemotherapy. ANITA is a randomized trial of adjuvant cisplatin and vinorelbine chemotherapy vs. observation in completely resected non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) Stages IB to IIIA. Use of PORT was recommended for pN+ disease but was not randomized or mandatory. Each center decided whether to use PORT before initiation of the study. We describe here the survival of patients with and without PORT within each treatment group of ANITA. No statistical comparison of survival was performed because this was an unplanned subgroup analysis. Overall, 232 of 840 patients received PORT (33.3% in the observation arm and 21.6% in the chemotherapy arm). In univariate analysis, PORT had a deleterious effect on the overall population survival. Patients with pN1 disease had an improved survival from PORT in the observation arm (median survival [MS] 25.9 vs. 50.2 months), whereas PORT had a detrimental effect in the chemotherapy group (MS 93.6 months and 46.6 months). In contrast, survival was improved in patients with pN2 disease who received PORT, both in the chemotherapy (MS 23.8 vs. 47.4 months) and observation arm (median 12.7 vs. 22.7 months). This retrospective evaluation suggests a positive effect of PORT in pN2 disease and a negative effect on pN1 disease when patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The results support further evaluation of PORT in prospectively randomized studies in completely resected pN2 NSCLC.

28	Radiotherapy plus chemotherapy with or without surgical resection for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase III randomised controlled trial.	2009	Results from phase II studies in patients with stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer with ipsilateral mediastinal nodal metastases (N2) have shown the feasibility of resection after concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy with promising rates of survival. We therefore did this phase III trial to compare concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by resection with standard concurrent chemotherapy and definitive radiotherapy without resection. Patients with stage T1-3pN2M0 non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to concurrent induction chemotherapy (two cycles of cisplatin [50 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 29, and 36] and etoposide [50 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and 29-33]) plus radiotherapy (45 Gy) in multiple academic and community hospitals. If no progression, patients in group 1 underwent resection and those in group 2 continued radiotherapy uninterrupted up to 61 Gy. Two additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide were given in both groups. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00002550. 202 patients (median age 59 years, range 31-77) were assigned to group 1 and 194 (61 years, 32-78) to group 2. Median OS was 23.6 months (IQR 9.0-not reached) in group 1 versus 22.2 months (9.4-52.7) in group 2 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87 [0.70-1.10]; p=0.24). Number of patients alive at 5 years was 37 (point estimate 27%) in group 1 and 24 (point estimate 20%) in group 2 (odds ratio 0.63 [0.36-1.10]; p=0.10). With N0 status at thoracotomy, the median OS was 34.4 months (IQR 15.7-not reached; 19 [point estimate 41%] patients alive at 5 years). Progression-free survival (PFS) was better in group 1 than in group 2, median 12.8 months (5.3-42.2) vs 10.5 months (4.8-20.6), HR 0.77 [0.62-0.96]; p=0.017); the number of patients without disease progression at 5 years was 32 (point estimate 22%) versus 13 (point estimate 11%), respectively. Neutropenia and oesophagitis were the main grade 3 or 4 toxicities associated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in group 1 (77 [38%] and 20 [10%], respectively) and group 2 (80 [41%] and 44 [23%], respectively). In group 1, 16 (8%) deaths were treatment related versus four (2%) in group 2. In an exploratory analysis, OS was improved for patients who underwent lobectomy, but not pneumonectomy, versus chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with or without resection (preferably lobectomy) are options for patients with stage IIIA(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer.

29	Phase III Study of Surgery Versus Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Boost in Patients With Resectable Stage IIIA(N2) and Selected IIIB Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer After Induction Chemotherapy and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (ESPATUE).	2016	Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without surgery are options for stage IIIA(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer. Our previous phase II study had shown the efficacy of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy and surgery in patients with IIIA(N2) disease and with selected IIIB disease. Here, we compared surgery with definitive chemoradiotherapy in resectable stage III disease after induction. Patients with pathologically proven IIIA(N2) and selected patients with IIIB disease that had medical/functional operability received induction chemotherapy, which consisted of three cycles of cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 21 days, as well as concurrent chemoradiotherapy to 45 Gy given as 1.5 Gy twice daily, concurrent cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9, and concurrent vinorelbine 20 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9. Those patients whose tumors were reevaluated and deemed resectable in the last week of radiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive a chemoradiotherapy boost that was risk adapted to between 65 and 71 Gy in arm A or to undergo surgery (arm B). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). After 246 of 500 planned patients were enrolled, the trial was closed after the second scheduled interim analysis because of slow accrual and the end of funding, which left the study underpowered relative to its primary study end point. Seventy-five patients had stage IIIA disease and 171 had stage IIIB disease according to the Union for International Cancer Control TNM classification, sixth edition. The median age was 59 years (range, 33 to 74 years). After induction, 161 (65.4%) of 246 patients with resectable tumors were randomly assigned; strata were tumor-node group, prophylactic cranial irradiation policy, and region. Patient characteristics were balanced between arms, in which 81 were assigned to surgery and 80 were assigned to a chemoradiotherapy boost. In arm B, 81% underwent R0 resection. With a median follow-up after random assignment of 78 months, 5-year OS and progression-free survival (PFS) did not differ between arms. Results were OS rates of 44% for arm B and 40% for arm A (log-rank P = .34) and PFS rates of 32% for arm B and 35% for arm A (log-rank P = .75). OS at 5 years was 34.1% (95% CI, 27.6% to 40.8%) in all 246 patients, and 216 patients (87.8%) received definitive local treatment. The 5-year OS and PFS rates in randomly assigned patients with resectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were excellent with both treatments. Both are acceptable strategies for this good-prognosis group.

30	Evidence supporting contemporary post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) using linear accelerators in N2 lung cancer.	2014	Post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) treatment for lung cancer declined since a meta-analysis failed to show benefit in patients with N2 disease. Because several included studies employed outmoded radiation planning and delivery techniques, we sought to determine whether PORT with modern technology benefits patients with N2 disease. We conducted searches of the published literature. For inclusion, studies must have included patients with stage III-N2 lung cancer treated with PORT using only linear accelerators, used a control group that did not receive PORT, and reported outcome data for overall survival (OS). Prospective and retrospective analyses were included. Exclusion criteria were the use of cobalt devices or orthovoltage radiation. Data were evaluated with random-effects models. Three prospective and eight retrospective studies were included. The PORT and no-PORT groups included 1368 and 1360 patients, respectively. The PORT group had significantly improved OS over the no-PORT group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.96, P = 0.020). Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) in 10 studies for which data was available was also improved in the PORT group (HR = 0.51, CI 0.41-0.65, P < 0.001). PORT was associated with significantly lower risk of death and locoregional recurrence in patients with N2 lung cancer. Our study was limited by lack of access to individual patient data, which would have enabled more detailed analyses. Regardless, data thus far suggest PORT may be associated with a survival benefit. Given a lack of large-scale prospective data, clinical trials evaluating PORT with modern technology are warranted.

32	Stereotactic body radiation therapy for early-stage non-small-cell lung carcinoma: four-year results of a prospective phase II study.	2009	The 50-month results of a prospective Phase II trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in medically inoperable patients are reported. A total of 70 medically inoperable patients had clinically staged T1 (34 patients) or T2 (36 patients) (< or =7 cm), N0, M0, biopsy-confirmed non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and received SBRT as per our previously published reports. The SBRT treatment dose of 60-66 Gy was prescribed to the 80% isodose volume in three fractions. Median follow-up was 50.2 months (range, 1.4-64.8 months). Kaplan-Meier local control at 3 years was 88.1%. Regional (nodal) and distant recurrence occurred in 6 (8.6%) and 9 (12.9%) patients, respectively. Median survival (MS) was 32.4 months and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 42.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 31.1-54.3%). Cancer-specific survival at 3 years was 81.7% (95% CI, 70.0-93.4%). For patients with T1 tumors, MS was 38.7 months (95% CI, 25.3-50.2) and for T2 tumors MS was 24.5 months (95% CI, 18.5-37.4) (p = 0.194). Tumor volume (< or =5 cc, 5-10 cc, 10-20 cc, >20 cc) did not significantly impact survival: MS was 36.9 months (95% CI, 18.1-42.9), 34.0 (95% CI, 16.9-57.1), 32.8 (95% CI, 21.3-57.8), and 21.4 months (95% CI, 17.8-41.6), respectively (p = 0.712). There was no significant survival difference between patients with peripheral vs. central tumors (MS 33.2 vs. 24.4 months, p = 0.697). Grade 3 to 5 toxicity occurred in 5 of 48 patients with peripheral lung tumors (10.4%) and in 6 of 22 patients (27.3%) with central tumors (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.088). Based on our study results, use of SBRT results in high rates of local control in medically inoperable patients with Stage I NSCLC.

The NSCLC Collaborative Group performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials directly comparing concomitant versus sequential radiochemotherapy. Systematic searches for trials were undertaken, followed by central collection, checking, and reanalysis of updated individual patient data. Results from trials were combined using the stratified log-rank test to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs). The primary outcome was overall survival; secondary outcomes were progression-free survival, cumulative incidences of locoregional and distant progression, and acute toxicity. Of seven eligible trials, data from six trials were received (1,205 patients, 92% of all randomly assigned patients). Median follow-up was 6 years. There was a significant benefit of concomitant radiochemotherapy on overall survival (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.95; P = .004), with an absolute benefit of 5.7% (from 18.1% to 23.8%) at 3 years and 4.5% at 5 years. For progression-free survival, the HR was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.01; P = .07). Concomitant treatment decreased locoregional progression (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95; P = .01); its effect was not different from that of sequential treatment on distant progression (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.25; P = .69). Concomitant radiochemotherapy increased acute esophageal toxicity (grade 3-4) from 4% to 18% with a relative risk of 4.9 (95% CI, 3.1 to 7.8; P < .001). There was no significant difference regarding acute pulmonary toxicity. Concomitant radiochemotherapy, as compared with sequential radiochemotherapy, improved survival of patients with locally advanced NSCLC, primarily because of a better locoregional control, but at the cost of manageable increased acute esophageal toxicity.

34	Induction chemoradiation and surgical resection for non-small cell lung carcinomas of the superior sulcus: Initial results of Southwest Oncology Group Trial 9416 (Intergroup Trial 0160).	2001	The rate of complete resection (50%) and the 5-year survival (30%) for non-small cell lung carcinomas of the superior sulcus have not changed for 40 years. Recently, combined modality therapy has improved outcome in other subsets of locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma. This trial tested the feasibility of induction chemoradiation and surgical resection in non-small cell lung carcinoma of the superior sulcus with the ultimate aim of improving resectability and survival. Patients with mediastinoscopy-negative T3-4 N0-1 superior sulcus non-small cell lung carcinoma received 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy concurrent with 45 Gy of radiation. Patients with stable or responding disease underwent thoracotomy 3 to 5 weeks later. All patients received 2 more cycles of chemotherapy and were followed up by serial radiographs and scans. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic factors were assessed for significance by Cox regression analysis. From April 1995 to September 1999, 111 eligible patients (77 men, 34 women) were entered in the study, including 80 (72.1%) with T3 and 31 with T4 tumors. Induction therapy was completed as planned in 102 (92%) patients. There were 3 treatment-related deaths (2.7%). Cytopenia was the main grade 3 to 4 toxicity. Of 95 patients eligible for surgery, 83 underwent thoracotomy, 2 (2.4%) died postoperatively, and 76 (92%) had a complete resection. Fifty-four (65%) thoracotomy specimens showed either a pathologic complete response or minimal microscopic disease. The 2-year survival was 55% for all eligible patients and 70% for patients who had a complete resection. To date, survival is not significantly influenced by patient sex, T status, or pathologic response. (1) This combined modality treatment is feasible in a multi-institutional setting; (2) the pathologic complete response rates were high; and (3) resectability and overall survival were improved compared with historical experience, especially for T4 tumors, which usually have a grim prognosis.

35	Patterns of disease recurrence after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for early stage non-small-cell lung cancer: a retrospective analysis.	2012	Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is increasingly used in the treatment of medically inoperable early stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because patterns of late disease recurrence after SABR are not well characterised, we aimed to assess these outcomes in a cohort of patients with NSCLC. Patients with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG)-PET confirmed stage 1-2 NSCLC who were treated with SABR at the VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, Netherlands) were identified from an institutional database. SABR doses were 54-60 Gy, delivered in three to eight once-daily fractions, depending on tumour size and location. Clinical follow-up and CT scans were done at 3, 6, and 12 months, then yearly thereafter. (18)F-FDG-PET restaging was only done when clinically indicated. Initial sites of recurrence were classified as local, regional, and distant, and were differentiated from second primary tumours in the lung at multidisciplinary tumour board review. Between April 4, 2003, and Dec 5, 2011, 676 patients were treated with SABR and were eligible for assessment of recurrence. The median follow-up was 32·9 months (IQR 14·9-50·9 months). 124 (18%) of 676 patients had disease recurrence. Actuarial 2-year rates of local, regional, and distant recurrence were 4·9% (95% CI 2·7-7·1), 7·8% (5·3-10·3), and 14·7% (11·4-18·0), respectively. Corresponding 5-year rates were 10·5% (95% CI 6·4-14·6), 12·7% (8·4-17·0), and 19·9% (14·9-24·6), respectively. Of the 124 recurrences, 82 (66%) were distant recurrences and 57 (46%) were isolated distant recurrences. Isolated locoregional recurrences occurred in the remaining 42 patients with disease recurrence (34%), 35 (83%) of whom did not develop subsequent distant recurrence. The median times to local, regional, and distant recurrence were 14·9 months (95% CI 11·4-18·4), 13·1 months (7·9-18·3), and 9·6 months (6·8-12·4), respectively. New pulmonary lesions characterised as second primary tumours in the lung developed in 42 (6%) of 676 patients at a median of 18·0 months (95% CI 12·5-23·5) after SABR. Late recurrences after SABR are infrequent and two distinct patterns account for most cases. The predominant pattern is out-of-field, isolated distant recurrence presenting early, despite initial PET staging. A third of patients develop isolated locoregional recurrence; for these patients standardised follow-up is important to ensure that appropriate salvage treatments are considered. None.

36	Effect of preoperative chemoradiation in addition to preoperative chemotherapy: a randomised trial in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer.	2008	Preoperative chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) amenable to resection. We aimed to assess the additional effect of preoperative chemoradiation on tumour resection, pathological response, and survival in these patients. Between Oct 1, 1995, and July 1, 2003, patients with stage IIIA-IIIB NSCLC and invasive mediastinal assessment from 26 participating institutions of the German Lung Cancer Cooperative Group (GLCCG) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The intervention group were scheduled to receive three cycles of cisplatin and etoposide, followed by twice-daily radiation with concurrent carboplatin and vindesine, and then surgical resection (those with positive resection margins or unresectable disease were offered further twice-daily radiotherapy). The control group were scheduled to receive three cycles of cisplatin and etoposide, followed by surgery, and then further radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients eligible for treatment after randomisation. Secondary endpoints in patients eligible for treatment after randomisation were overall survival (OS) and the proportion of patients undergoing surgery. Secondary endpoints in patients with tumour resection were the proportion with negative resection margins, the proportion with complete resection, the proportion with histopathological response, and the proportion with mediastinal downstaging. Additionally, exploratory (not prespecified) post-hoc analyses in terms of PFS and OS were done on patients not amenable to resection and on further subgroups of patients undergoing resection. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website, number NCT 00176137. 558 patients were randomly assigned. 34 patients did not meet inclusion criteria and were excluded. Of 524 eligible patients, 142 of 264 (54%) in the interventional group and 154 of 260 (59%) in the control group underwent surgery; 98 of 264 (37%) and 84 of 260 (32%) underwent complete resection. In patients with complete resection, the proportion of those with mediastinal downstaging (45 of 98 [46%] and 24 of 84 [29%], p=0.02) and pathological response (59 of 98 [60%] and 17 of 84 [20%], p<0.0001) favoured the interventional group. However, there was no difference in PFS (primary endpoint) between treatment groups-either in eligible patients (median PFS 9.5 months, range 1.0-117.0 [95% CI 8.3-11.2] vs 10.0 months, range 1.0-111.0 [8.9-11.5], 5-year PFS 16% [11-21] vs 14% [10-19], hazard ratio (HR) 0.99 [0.81-1.19], p=0.87), in those undergoing tumour resection, or in patients with complete resection. In both groups, 35% of patients undergoing surgery received a pneumonectomy (50/142 vs 54/154). In patients receiving a pneumonectomy, treatment-related mortality increased in the interventional group compared with the control group (7/50 [14%] vs 3/54 [6%]). In patients with stage III NSCLC amenable to surgery, preoperative chemoradiation in addition to chemotherapy increases pathological response and mediastinal downstaging, but does not improve survival. After induction with chemoradiation, pneumonectomy should be avoided. German Cancer Aid (Bonn, Germany).

37	Postoperative radiotherapy for stage II or III non-small-cell lung cancer using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database.	2006	To investigate the association between survival and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in patients with resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we selected patients with stage II or III NSCLC who underwent a lobectomy or pneumonectomy. Only those patients coded as receiving PORT or observation were included. To account for perioperative mortality, we excluded patients who survived less than 4 months. As a result of our inclusion criteria, we selected a total of 7,465 patients, with a median follow-up time of 3.5 years for patients still alive. Predictors for the use of PORT included age less than 50 years, higher American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, T3-4 tumor stage, larger tumor size, advanced node stage, greater number of lymph nodes involved, and a ratio of lymph nodes involved to lymph nodes sampled approaching 1.00. On multivariate analysis, older age, T3-4 tumor stage, N2 node stage, male sex, fewer sampled lymph nodes, and greater number of involved lymph nodes had a negative impact on survival. The use of PORT did not have a significant impact on survival. However, in subset analysis for patients with N2 nodal disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.855; 95% CI, 0.762 to 0.959; P = .0077), PORT was associated with a significant increase in survival. For patients with N0 (HR = 1.176; 95% CI, 1.005 to 1.376; P = .0435) and N1 (HR = 1.097; 95% CI, 1.015 to 1.186; P = .0196) nodal disease, PORT was associated with a significant decrease in survival. In a population-based cohort, PORT use is associated with an increase in survival in patients with N2 nodal disease but not in patients with N1 and N0 nodal disease.

38	Lung adjuvant cisplatin evaluation: a pooled analysis by the LACE Collaborative Group.	2008	Several recent trials have shown a significant overall survival (OS) benefit from postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of the Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation was to identify treatment options associated with a higher benefit or groups of patients who particularly benefit from postoperative chemotherapy. Individual patient data were collected and pooled from the five largest trials (4,584 patients) of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in completely resected patients that were conducted after the 1995 NSCLC meta-analysis. The interactions between patient subgroups or treatment types and chemotherapy effect on OS were analyzed using hazard ratios (HRs) and log-rank tests stratified by trial. With a median follow-up time of 5.2 years, the overall HR of death was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.96; P = .005), corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy. There was no heterogeneity of chemotherapy effect among trials. The benefit varied with stage (test for trend, P = .04; HR for stage IA = 1.40; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.06; HR for stage IB = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.10; HR for stage II = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; and HR for stage III = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94). The effect of chemotherapy did not vary significantly (test for interaction, P = .11) with the associated drugs, including vinorelbine (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.91), etoposide or vinca alkaloid (HR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.07), or other (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.13). Chemotherapy effect was higher in patients with better performance status. There was no interaction between chemotherapy effect and sex, age, histology, type of surgery, planned radiotherapy, or planned total dose of cisplatin. Postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improves survival in patients with NSCLC.

39	Institutional Enrollment and Survival Among NSCLC Patients Receiving Chemoradiation: NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0617.	2017	The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the effect of institutional accrual volume on clinical outcomes among patients receiving chemoradiation for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) on a phase III trial. Patients with LA-NSCLC were randomly assigned to 60 Gy or 74 Gy radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent carboplatin/paclitaxel +/- cetuximab on NRG Oncology RTOG 0617. Participating institutions were categorized as low-volume centers (LVCs) or high-volume centers (HVCs) according to the number of patients accrued (≤3 vs > 3). All statistical tests were two-sided. Range of accrual for LVCs (n = 195) vs HVCs (n = 300) was 1 to 3 vs 4 to 18 patients. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two cohorts. Treatment at a HVC was associated with statistically significantly longer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with treatment at a LVC (median OS = 26.2 vs 19.8 months; HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.88, P = .002; median PFS: 11.4 vs 9.7 months, HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65-0.99, P = .04). Patients treated at HVCs were more often treated with intensity-modulated RT (54.0% vs 39.5%, P = .002), had a lower esophageal dose (mean = 26.1 vs 28.0 Gy, P = .03), and had a lower heart dose (median = V5 Gy 38.2% vs 54.1%, P = .006; V50 Gy 3.6% vs 7.3%, P < .001). Grade 5 adverse events (AEs) (5.3% vs 9.2%, P = .09) and RT termination because of AEs (1.3% vs 4.1%, P = .07) were less common among patients treated at HVCs. HVC remained independently associated with longer OS (P = .03) when accounting for other factors. Treatment at institutions with higher clinical trial accrual volume is associated with longer OS among patients with LA-NSCLC participating in a phase III trial.

40	Sequential vs. concurrent chemoradiation for stage III non-small cell lung cancer: randomized phase III trial RTOG 9410.	2011	The combination of chemotherapy with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) compared with TRT alone has been shown to confer a survival advantage for good performance status patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. However, it is not known whether sequential or concurrent delivery of these therapies is the optimal combination strategy. A total of 610 patients were randomly assigned to two concurrent regimens and one sequential chemotherapy and TRT regimen in a three-arm phase III trial. The sequential arm included cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29 and vinblastine at 5 mg/m2 per week for 5 weeks with 63 Gy TRT delivered as once-daily fractions beginning on day 50. Arm 2 used the same chemotherapy regimen as arm 1 with 63 Gy TRT delivered as once-daily fractions beginning on day 1 [corrected]. Arm 3 used cisplatin at 50 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 with oral etoposide at 50 mg twice daily for 10 weeks on days 1, 2, 5, and 6 with 69.6 Gy delivered as 1.2 Gy twice-daily fractions beginning on day 1. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints included tumor response and time to tumor progression. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess survival, and toxic effects were examined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Median survival times were 14.6, 17.0, and 15.6 months for arms 1-3, respectively. Five-year survival was statistically significantly higher for patients treated with the concurrent regimen with once-daily TRT compared with the sequential treatment (5-year survival: sequential, arm 1, 10% [20 patients], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7% to 15%; concurrent, arm 2, 16% [31 patients], 95% CI = 11% to 22%, P = .046; concurrent, arm 3, 13% [22 patients], 95% CI = 9% to 18%). With a median follow-up time of 11 years, the rates of acute grade 3-5 nonhematologic toxic effects were higher with concurrent than sequential therapy, but late toxic effects were similar. Concurrent delivery of cisplatin-based chemotherapy with TRT confers a long-term survival benefit compared with the sequential delivery of these therapies.

41	Adjuvant radiation therapy in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Executive summary of an American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) evidence-based clinical practice guideline.	2016	To provide guidance to physicians and patients with regard to the use of adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (RT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC) based on available medical evidence complemented by consensus-based expert opinion. A panel authorized by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Board of Directors and Guidelines Subcommittee conducted 2 systematic reviews on the following topics: (1) indications for postoperative adjuvant RT and (2) indications for preoperative neoadjuvant RT. Practice guideline recommendations were approved using an a priori-defined consensus-building methodology supported by ASTRO and approved tools for the grading of evidence quality and the strength of guideline recommendations. For patients who have undergone surgical resection, high-level evidence suggests that use of postoperative RT does not influence survival, but optimizes local control for patients with N2 involvement, and its use in the setting of positive margins or gross primary/nodal residual disease is recommended. No high-level evidence exists for the routine use of preoperative induction chemoradiation therapy; however, modern surgical series and a post-hoc Intergroup 0139 clinical trial analysis suggest that a survival benefit may exist if patients are properly selected and surgical techniques/postoperative care is optimized. A consensus and evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the adjuvant radiotherapeutic management of LA NSCLC has been created addressing 2 important questions.

42	Final results of phase III trial in regionally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, and Southwest Oncology Group.	2000	The purpose of this phase III clinical trial was to test whether chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy resulted in superior survival to either hyperfractionated radiation or standard radiation in surgically unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. Patients were prospectively randomized to 2 months of cisplatin, vinblastine chemotherapy followed by 60 Gy of radiation at 2.0 Gy per fraction or 1.2 Gy per fraction radiation delivered twice daily to a total dose of 69.6 Gy, or 2.0 Gy per fraction of radiation once daily to 60 Gy. Patients were enrolled from January 1989 through January 1992, and followed for a potential minimum period of 5 years. This trial was an intergroup National Cancer Institute-funded trial within the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, and the Southwest Oncology Group. Patients with surgically unresectable non-small cell lung cancer, clinical stage II, IIIA, and IIIB, were required to have a Karnofsky Performance Status of > or = 70 and a weight loss of < 5% for 3 months before study entry. Four hundred ninety patients were registered on trial, of which 458 patients were eligible. Overall survival was statistically superior for the patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation vs the other two arms of the study. The twice-daily radiation therapy arm, although better, was not statistically superior in survival for those patients receiving standard radiation. Median survival for standard radiation was 11.4 months; for chemotherapy and irradiation, 13.2 months; and for hyperfractionated irradiation, 12 months. The respective 5-year survivals were 5% for standard radiation therapy, 8% for chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy, and 6% for hyperfractionated irradiation.

43	Impact of postoperative radiation therapy on survival in patients with complete resection and stage I, II, or IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: the adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association (ANITA) Randomized Trial.	2008	To study the impact of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) on survival in the Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association (ANITA) randomized study of adjuvant chemotherapy. ANITA is a randomized trial of adjuvant cisplatin and vinorelbine chemotherapy vs. observation in completely resected non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) Stages IB to IIIA. Use of PORT was recommended for pN+ disease but was not randomized or mandatory. Each center decided whether to use PORT before initiation of the study. We describe here the survival of patients with and without PORT within each treatment group of ANITA. No statistical comparison of survival was performed because this was an unplanned subgroup analysis. Overall, 232 of 840 patients received PORT (33.3% in the observation arm and 21.6% in the chemotherapy arm). In univariate analysis, PORT had a deleterious effect on the overall population survival. Patients with pN1 disease had an improved survival from PORT in the observation arm (median survival [MS] 25.9 vs. 50.2 months), whereas PORT had a detrimental effect in the chemotherapy group (MS 93.6 months and 46.6 months). In contrast, survival was improved in patients with pN2 disease who received PORT, both in the chemotherapy (MS 23.8 vs. 47.4 months) and observation arm (median 12.7 vs. 22.7 months). This retrospective evaluation suggests a positive effect of PORT in pN2 disease and a negative effect on pN1 disease when patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The results support further evaluation of PORT in prospectively randomized studies in completely resected pN2 NSCLC.

44	A Randomized Phase 2 Study Comparing 2 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Schedules for Medically Inoperable Patients With Stage I Peripheral Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: NRG Oncology RTOG 0915 (NCCTG N0927).	2016	To compare 2 stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) schedules for medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer to determine which produces the lowest rate of grade ≥3 protocol-specified adverse events (psAEs) at 1 year. Patients with biopsy-proven peripheral (≥2 cm from the central bronchial tree) T1 or T2, N0 (clinically node negative by positron emission tomography), M0 tumors were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either 34 Gy in 1 fraction (arm 1) or 48 Gy in 4 consecutive daily fractions (arm 2). Rigorous central accreditation and quality assurance confirmed treatment per protocol guidelines. This study was designed to detect a psAEs rate >17% at a 10% significance level (1-sided) and 90% power. Secondary endpoints included rates of primary tumor control (PC), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year. Designating the better of the 2 regimens was based on prespecified rules of psAEs and PC for each arm. Ninety-four patients were accrued between September 2009 and March 2011. The median follow-up time was 30.2 months. Of 84 analyzable patients, 39 were in arm 1 and 45 in arm 2. Patient and tumor characteristics were balanced between arms. Four (10.3%) patients on arm 1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9%-24.2%) and 6 (13.3%) patients on arm 2 (95% CI 5.1%-26.8%) experienced psAEs. The 2-year OS rate was 61.3% (95% CI 44.2%-74.6%) for arm 1 patients and 77.7% (95% CI 62.5%-87.3%) for arm 2. The 2-year DFS was 56.4% (95% CI 39.6%-70.2%) for arm 1 and 71.1% (95% CI 55.5%-82.1%) for arm 2. The 1-year PC rate was 97.0% (95% CI 84.2%-99.9%) for arm 1 and 92.7% (95% CI 80.1%-98.5%) for arm 2. 34 Gy in 1 fraction met the prespecified criteria and, of the 2 schedules, warrants further clinical research.

45	Standard-dose versus high-dose conformal radiotherapy with concurrent and consolidation carboplatin plus paclitaxel with or without cetuximab for patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer (RTOG 0617): a randomised, two-by-two factorial phase 3 study.	2015	We aimed to compare overall survival after standard-dose versus high-dose conformal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy and the addition of cetuximab to concurrent chemoradiation for patients with inoperable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. In this open-label randomised, two-by-two factorial phase 3 study in 185 institutions in the USA and Canada, we enrolled patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer, a Zubrod performance status of 0-1, adequate pulmonary function, and no evidence of supraclavicular or contralateral hilar adenopathy. We randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) patients to receive either 60 Gy (standard dose), 74 Gy (high dose), 60 Gy plus cetuximab, or 74 Gy plus cetuximab. All patients also received concurrent chemotherapy with 45 mg/m(2) paclitaxel and carboplatin once a week (AUC 2); 2 weeks after chemoradiation, two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy separated by 3 weeks were given consisting of paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC 6). Randomisation was done with permuted block randomisation methods, stratified by radiotherapy technique, Zubrod performance status, use of PET during staging, and histology; treatment group assignments were not masked. Radiation dose was prescribed to the planning target volume and was given in 2 Gy daily fractions with either intensity-modulated radiation therapy or three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. The use of four-dimensional CT and image-guided radiation therapy were encouraged but not necessary. For patients assigned to receive cetuximab, 400 mg/m(2) cetuximab was given on day 1 followed by weekly doses of 250 mg/m(2), and was continued through consolidation therapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival. All analyses were done by modified intention-to-treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00533949. Between Nov 27, 2007, and Nov 22, 2011, 166 patients were randomly assigned to receive standard-dose chemoradiotherapy, 121 to high-dose chemoradiotherapy, 147 to standard-dose chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab, and 110 to high-dose chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab. Median follow-up for the radiotherapy comparison was 22.9 months (IQR 27.5-33.3). Median overall survival was 28.7 months (95% CI 24.1-36.9) for patients who received standard-dose radiotherapy and 20.3 months (17.7-25.0) for those who received high-dose radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.09-1.76; p=0.004). Median follow-up for the cetuximab comparison was 21.3 months (IQR 23.5-29.8). Median overall survival in patients who received cetuximab was 25.0 months (95% CI 20.2-30.5) compared with 24.0 months (19.8-28.6) in those who did not (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84-1.35; p=0.29). Both the radiation-dose and cetuximab results crossed protocol-specified futility boundaries. We recorded no statistical differences in grade 3 or worse toxic effects between radiotherapy groups. By contrast, the use of cetuximab was associated with a higher rate of grade 3 or worse toxic effects (205 [86%] of 237 vs 160 [70%] of 228 patients; p<0.0001). There were more treatment-related deaths in the high-dose chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab groups (radiotherapy comparison: eight vs three patients; cetuximab comparison: ten vs five patients). There were no differences in severe pulmonary events between treatment groups. Severe oesophagitis was more common in patients who received high-dose chemoradiotherapy than in those who received standard-dose treatment (43 [21%] of 207 patients vs 16 [7%] of 217 patients; p<0.0001). 74 Gy radiation given in 2 Gy fractions with concurrent chemotherapy was not better than 60 Gy plus concurrent chemotherapy for patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer, and might be potentially harmful. Addition of cetuximab to concurrent chemoradiation and consolidation treatment provided no benefit in overall survival for these patients. National Cancer Institute and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

46	Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy compared with chemoradiotherapy alone for regionally advanced unresectable stage III Non-small-cell lung cancer: Cancer and Leukemia Group B.	2007	Standard therapy for unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer includes concomitant chemoradiotherapy. In Cancer and Leukemia Group B 39801, we evaluated whether induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemoradiotherapy would result in improved survival. Between July 1998 and May 2002, 366 patients were randomly assigned to arm A, which involved immediate concurrent chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 2 and paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 given weekly during 66 Gy of chest radiotherapy, or arm B, which involved two cycles of carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 administered every 21 days followed by identical chemoradiotherapy. The accrual goal was 360 patients. Thirty-four percent of patients were female, 66% were male, and the median age was 63 years. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities during induction chemotherapy on arm B consisted mainly of neutropenia (18% and 20%, respectively). During concurrent chemoradiotherapy, there was no difference in severity of in-field toxicities of esophagitis (grade 3 and 4 were, respectively, 30% and 2% for arm A v 28% and 8% for arm B) and dyspnea (grade 3 and 4 were, respectively, 11% and 3% for arm A v 15% and 4% for arm B). Survival differences were not statistically significant (P = .3), with a median survival on arm A of 12 months (95% CI, 10 to 16 months) versus 14 months (95% CI, 11 to 16 months) on arm B and a 2-year survival of 29% (95% CI, 22% to 35%) and 31% (95% CI, 25% to 38%). Age, weight loss before therapy, and performance status were statistically significant predictive factors. The addition of induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy added toxicity and provided no survival benefit over concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone. The median survival achieved in each of the treatment groups is low, and the routine use of weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel with simultaneous radiotherapy should be re-examined.

47	Safety and Efficacy of a Five-Fraction Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Schedule for Centrally Located Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: NRG Oncology/RTOG 0813 Trial.		Patients with centrally located early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are at a higher risk of toxicity from high-dose ablative radiotherapy. NRG Oncology/RTOG 0813 was a phase I/II study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), efficacy, and toxicity of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for centrally located NSCLC. Medically inoperable patients with biopsy-proven, positron emission tomography-staged T1 to 2 (≤ 5 cm) N0M0 centrally located NSCLC were accrued into a dose-escalating, five-fraction SBRT schedule that ranged from 10 to 12 Gy/fraction (fx) delivered over 1.5 to 2 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any treatment-related grade 3 or worse predefined toxicity that occurred within the first year. MTD was defined as the SBRT dose at which the probability of DLT was closest to 20% without exceeding it. One hundred twenty patients were accrued between February 2009 and September 2013. Patients were elderly, there were slightly more females, and the majority had a performance status of 0 to 1. Most cancers were T1 (65%) and squamous cell (45%). Organs closest to planning target volume/most at risk were the main bronchus and large vessels. Median follow-up was 37.9 months. Five patients experienced DLTs; MTD was 12.0 Gy/fx, which had a probability of a DLT of 7.2% (95% CI, 2.8% to 14.5%). Two-year rates for the 71 evaluable patients in the 11.5 and 12.0 Gy/fx cohorts were local control, 89.4% (90% CI, 81.6% to 97.4%) and 87.9% (90% CI, 78.8% to 97.0%); overall survival, 67.9% (95% CI, 50.4% to 80.3%) and 72.7% (95% CI, 54.1% to 84.8%); and progression-free survival, 52.2% (95% CI, 35.3% to 66.6%) and 54.5% (95% CI, 36.3% to 69.6%), respectively. The MTD for this study was 12.0 Gy/fx; it was associated with 7.2% DLTs and high rates of tumor control. Outcomes in this medically inoperable group of mostly elderly patients with comorbidities were comparable with that of patients with peripheral early-stage tumors.

48	Postoperative radiotherapy for pathologic N2 non-small-cell lung cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: a review of the National Cancer Data Base.	2015	To investigate the impact of modern postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on overall survival (OS) for patients with N2 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated nationally with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with pathologic N2 NSCLC who underwent complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy from 2006 to 2010 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base and stratified by use of PORT (≥ 45 Gy). A total of 4,483 patients were identified (PORT, n = 1,850; no PORT, n = 2,633). The impact of patient and treatment variables on OS was explored using Cox regression. Median follow-up time was 22 months. On univariable analysis, improved OS correlated with younger age, treatment at an academic facility, female sex, urban population, higher income, lower Charlson comorbidity score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT. On multivariable analysis, improved OS remained independently predicted by younger age, female sex, urban population, lower Charlson score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT (hazard ratio, 0.886; 95% CI, 0.798 to 0.988). Use of PORT was associated with an increase in median and 5-year OS compared with no PORT (median OS, 45.2 v 40.7 months, respectively; 5-year OS, 39.3% [95% CI, 35.4% to 43.5%] v 34.8% [95% CI, 31.6% to 38.3%], respectively; P = .014). For patients with N2 NSCLC after complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, modern PORT seems to confer an additional OS advantage beyond that achieved with adjuvant chemotherapy alone.

49	A randomized trial of induction chemotherapy plus high-dose radiation versus radiation alone in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer.	1990	For patients with locally or regionally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer radiation is the standard treatment, but survival remains poor. We therefore conducted a randomized trial to determine whether induction chemotherapy before irradiation improves survival. All the patients had documented non-small-cell cancer of the lung with Stage III disease established by clinical or surgical staging. Eligibility requirements included excellent performance status, minimal weight loss, and visible disease on radiography. Patients randomly assigned to group 1 received cisplatin (100 mg per square meter of body-surface area given intravenously on days 1 and 29) and vinblastine (5 mg per square meter given intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29) and then began radiation therapy on day 50 (60 Gy over a 6-week period). Patients assigned to group 2 received the same radiation therapy but began it immediately and received no chemotherapy. The eligible patients in group 1 (n = 78) and group 2 (n = 77) were comparable in terms of age (median, 60 years), sex, performance status, histologic features, stage of disease, and completeness of radiation therapy. The median survival was greater for those in group 1-13.8 versus 9.7 months (P = 0.0066 by log-rank test). Rates of survival in group 1 were 55 percent after one year, 26 percent after two years, and 23 percent after three years, as compared with 40, 13, and 11 percent, respectively, in group 2. Those in group 1 had a higher incidence of serious infections requiring hospitalization (7 percent, vs. 3 percent in group 2) and severe weight loss (14 percent vs. 6 percent), but there were no treatment-related deaths. In patients with Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer, induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinblastine before radiation significantly improves median survival (by about four months) and doubles the number of long-term survivors, as compared with radiation therapy alone. Since three quarters of the patients still die within three years, however, further improvements in systemic and local therapy are needed.

50	Survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: an updated meta-analysis of 13 randomized control trials.	2010	The survival effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear based on the study of most up-to-date literatures. This article contributes to this problem by conducting an updated meta-analysis. Based on Burdett et al's (J Thorac Oncol 2006;1:611-621) systematic review, this meta-analysis was conducted. Articles were searched electrically. The possible survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was assessed by hazard ratio (HR) in terms of overall survival. A subgroup meta-analysis with only stage III NSCLC was also conducted. The software of Review Manager was used for data management. Thirteen randomized control trials, 6 of which were new ones, were included into this meta-analysis. The overall survival of NSCLC patients in neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm were improved significantly, comparing with those in surgery-alone arm (combined HR = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.92; p = 0.0001). When only patients with stage III NSCLC were considered, the result was similar (combined HR = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.95; p = 0.005). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as an addition of surgery, would significantly improve the overall survival of operable NSCLC patients, including patients with stage III NSCLC.

51	Evidence supporting contemporary post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) using linear accelerators in N2 lung cancer.	2014	Post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) treatment for lung cancer declined since a meta-analysis failed to show benefit in patients with N2 disease. Because several included studies employed outmoded radiation planning and delivery techniques, we sought to determine whether PORT with modern technology benefits patients with N2 disease. We conducted searches of the published literature. For inclusion, studies must have included patients with stage III-N2 lung cancer treated with PORT using only linear accelerators, used a control group that did not receive PORT, and reported outcome data for overall survival (OS). Prospective and retrospective analyses were included. Exclusion criteria were the use of cobalt devices or orthovoltage radiation. Data were evaluated with random-effects models. Three prospective and eight retrospective studies were included. The PORT and no-PORT groups included 1368 and 1360 patients, respectively. The PORT group had significantly improved OS over the no-PORT group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.96, P = 0.020). Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) in 10 studies for which data was available was also improved in the PORT group (HR = 0.51, CI 0.41-0.65, P < 0.001). PORT was associated with significantly lower risk of death and locoregional recurrence in patients with N2 lung cancer. Our study was limited by lack of access to individual patient data, which would have enabled more detailed analyses. Regardless, data thus far suggest PORT may be associated with a survival benefit. Given a lack of large-scale prospective data, clinical trials evaluating PORT with modern technology are warranted.

52	Stereotactic hypofractionated high-dose irradiation for stage I nonsmall cell lung carcinoma: clinical outcomes in 245 subjects in a Japanese multiinstitutional study.	2004	Stereotactic irradiation (STI) has been actively performed using various methods to achieve better local control of Stage I nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in Japan. The authors retrospectively evaluated results from a Japanese multiinstitutional study. Patients with Stage I NSCLC (n = 245; median age, 76 years; T1N0M0, n = 155; T2N0M0, n = 90) were treated with hypofractionated high-dose STI in 13 institutions. Stereotactic three-dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. A total dose of 18-75 gray (Gy) at the isocenter was administered in 1-22 fractions. The median calculated biologic effective dose (BED) was 108 Gy (range, 57-180 Gy). During follow-up (median, 24 months; range, 7-78 months), pulmonary complications of National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria Grade > 2 were observed in only 6 patients (2.4%). Local progression occurred in 33 patients (14.5%), and the local recurrence rate was 8.1% for BED > or = 100 Gy compared with 26.4% for < 100 Gy (P < 0.05). The 3-year overall survival rate of medically operable patients was 88.4% for BED > or = 100 Gy compared with 69.4% for < 100 Gy (P < 0.05). Hypofractionated high-dose STI with BED < 150 Gy was feasible and beneficial for curative treatment of patients with Stage I NSCLC. For all treatment methods and schedules, local control and survival rates were better with BED > or = 100 Gy compared with < 100 Gy. Survival rates in selected patients (medically operable, BED > or = 100 Gy) were excellent, and were potentially comparable to those of surgery.

53	Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Operable Early-Stage Lung Cancer: Findings From the NRG Oncology RTOG 0618 Trial.		Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has become a standard treatment for patients with medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer. However, its effectiveness in patients medically suitable for surgery is unclear. To evaluate whether noninvasive SBRT delivered on an outpatient basis can safely eradicate lung cancer and cure selected patients with operable lung cancer, obviating the need for surgical resection. Single-arm phase 2 NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0618 study enrolled patients from December 2007 to May 2010 with median follow-up of 48.1 months (range, 15.4-73.7 months). The setting was a multicenter North American academic and community practice cancer center consortium. Patients had operable biopsy-proven peripheral T1 to T2, N0, M0 non-small cell tumors no more than 5 cm in diameter, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusing capacity greater than 35% predicted, arterial oxygen tension greater than 60 mm Hg, arterial carbon dioxide tension less than 50 mm Hg, and no severe medical problems. The data analysis was performed in October 2014. The SBRT prescription dose was 54 Gy delivered in 3 18-Gy fractions over 1.5 to 2.0 weeks. Primary end point was primary tumor control, with survival, adverse events, and the incidence and outcome of surgical salvage as secondary end points. Of 33 patients accrued, 26 were evaluable (23 T1 and 3 T2 tumors; 15 [58%] male; median age, 72.5 [range, 54-88] years). Median FEV1 and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide at enrollment were 72.5% (range, 38%-136%) and 68% (range, 22%-96%) of predicted, respectively. Only 1 patient had a primary tumor recurrence. Involved lobe failure, the other component defining local failure, did not occur in any patient, so the estimated 4-year primary tumor control and local control rate were both 96% (95% CI, 83%-100%). As per protocol guidelines, the single patient with local recurrence underwent salvage lobectomy 1.2 years after SBRT, complicated by a grade 4 cardiac arrhythmia. The 4-year estimates of disease-free and overall survival were 57% (95% CI, 36%-74%) and 56% (95% CI, 35%-73%), respectively. Median overall survival was 55.2 months (95% CI, 37.7 months to not reached). Protocol-specified treatment-related grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse events were reported in 2 (8%; 95% CI, 0.1%-25%), 0, and 0 patients, respectively. As given, SBRT appears to be associated with a high rate of primary tumor control, low treatment-related morbidity, and infrequent need for surgical salvage in patients with operable early-stage lung cancer.

54	Randomized controlled trial of resection versus radiotherapy after induction chemotherapy in stage IIIA-N2 non-small-cell lung cancer.	2007	Induction chemotherapy before surgical resection increases survival compared with surgical resection alone in patients with stage IIIA-N2 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesized that, following a response to induction chemotherapy, surgical resection would be superior to thoracic radiotherapy as locoregional therapy. Selected patients with histologic or cytologic proven stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC were given three cycles of platinum-based induction chemotherapy. Responding patients were subsequently randomly assigned to surgical resection or radiotherapy. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analyses from time of randomization. Induction chemotherapy resulted in a response rate of 61% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 57% to 65%) among the 579 eligible patients. A total of 167 patients were allocated to resection and 165 to radiotherapy. Of the 154 (92%) patients who underwent surgery, 14% had an exploratory thoracotomy, 50% a radical resection, 42% a pathologic downstaging, and 5% a pathologic complete response; 4% died after surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered to 62 (40%) of patients in the surgery arm. Among the 154 (93%) irradiated patients, overall compliance to the radiotherapy prescription was 55%, and grade 3/4 acute and late esophageal and pulmonary toxic effects occurred in 4% and 7%; one patient died of radiation pneumonitis. Median and 5-year overall survival for patients randomly assigned to resection versus radiotherapy were 16.4 versus 17.5 months and 15.7% versus 14%, respectively (hazard ratio = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.35). Rates of progression-free survival were also similar in both groups. In selected patients with pathologically proven stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC and a response to induction chemotherapy, surgical resection did not improve overall or progression-free survival compared with radiotherapy. In view of its low morbidity and mortality, radiotherapy should be considered the preferred locoregional treatment for these patients.	van Meerbeeck JP, Kramer GW, Van Schil PE, Legrand C, Smit EF, Schramel F, Tjan-Heijnen VC, Biesma B, Debruyne C, van Zandwijk N, Splinter TA, Giaccone G, None None	17374834	10.1093/jnci/djk093	["22976995", "28454304", "29593890", "26137291", "24384493", "27382305", "30023125", "28210169", "27942405", "22237260", "30069356", "28415831", "29776444", "28110809", "27566586", "28123901", "26719403", "23571473", "29527511", "20677631", "29410947", "24176164", "22276032", "28246582", "25061519", "29456881", "28740705", "28527969", "23633970", "21904576", "25806307", "25071132", "28671758", "28265739", "27117590", "24465227", "26893872", "25207414", "29312668", "22649759", "29742701", "29268415", "24163751", "25806262", "22205919", "30446985", "25441139", "28426673", "19632716", "26380768", "29081843", "26319488", "29849189", "30827328", "19329207", "23517534", "27903462", "30123558", "25496482", "26061306", "25489265", "27085484", "25943191", "22670114", "23847765", "26579815", "29221230", "29221282", "29147226", "22234041", "30746228", "22118497", "23143203", "26628866", "25498887", "21378080", "27472701", "28339761", "30551965", "26410162", "28706909", "27942406", "28839962", "18166842", "29147370", "20704818", "22354091", "25936471", "29607613", "26163324", "26984447", "29124039", "27600665", "25641029", "19881166", "30212928", "27702837", "24722151", "26217121", "28148889", "26244136", "26259994", "26273396", "26955282", "26614420"]	[]	4	["Combined", "Chemotherapy", "Non-Small-Cell", "Neoplasms", "Antineoplastic", "Lung", "Carcinoma", "Protocols"]

56	Lung adjuvant cisplatin evaluation: a pooled analysis by the LACE Collaborative Group.	2008	Several recent trials have shown a significant overall survival (OS) benefit from postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of the Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation was to identify treatment options associated with a higher benefit or groups of patients who particularly benefit from postoperative chemotherapy. Individual patient data were collected and pooled from the five largest trials (4,584 patients) of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in completely resected patients that were conducted after the 1995 NSCLC meta-analysis. The interactions between patient subgroups or treatment types and chemotherapy effect on OS were analyzed using hazard ratios (HRs) and log-rank tests stratified by trial. With a median follow-up time of 5.2 years, the overall HR of death was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.96; P = .005), corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy. There was no heterogeneity of chemotherapy effect among trials. The benefit varied with stage (test for trend, P = .04; HR for stage IA = 1.40; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.06; HR for stage IB = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.10; HR for stage II = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; and HR for stage III = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94). The effect of chemotherapy did not vary significantly (test for interaction, P = .11) with the associated drugs, including vinorelbine (HR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.91), etoposide or vinca alkaloid (HR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.07), or other (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.13). Chemotherapy effect was higher in patients with better performance status.

57	Postoperative radiotherapy for pathologic N2 non-small-cell lung cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: a review of the National Cancer Data Base.	2015	To investigate the impact of modern postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on overall survival (OS) for patients with N2 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated nationally with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with pathologic N2 NSCLC who underwent complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy from 2006 to 2010 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base and stratified by use of PORT (≥ 45 Gy). A total of 4,483 patients were identified (PORT, n = 1,850; no PORT, n = 2,633). The impact of patient and treatment variables on OS was explored using Cox regression. Median follow-up time was 22 months. On univariable analysis, improved OS correlated with younger age, treatment at an academic facility, female sex, urban population, higher income, lower Charlson comorbidity score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT. On multivariable analysis, improved OS remained independently predicted by younger age, female sex, urban population, lower Charlson score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT (hazard ratio, 0.886; 95% CI, 0.798 to 0.988). Use of PORT was associated with an increase in median and 5-year OS compared with no PORT (median OS, 45.2 v 40.7 months, respectively; 5-year OS, 39.3% [95% CI, 35.4% to 43.5%] v 34.8% [95% CI, 31.6% to 38.3%], respectively; P = .014). For patients with N2 NSCLC after complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, modern PORT seems to confer an additional OS advantage beyond that achieved with adjuvant chemotherapy alone.

58	Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy versus lobectomy for operable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer: a pooled analysis of two randomised trials.	2015	The standard of care for operable, stage I, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for inoperable stage I NSCLC has shown promising results, but two independent, randomised, phase 3 trials of SABR in patients with operable stage I NSCLC (STARS and ROSEL) closed early due to slow accrual. We aimed to assess overall survival for SABR versus surgery by pooling data from these trials. Eligible patients in the STARS and ROSEL studies were those with clinical T1-2a (<4 cm), N0M0, operable NSCLC. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to SABR or lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling. We did a pooled analysis in the intention-to-treat population using overall survival as the primary endpoint. Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (STARS: NCT00840749; ROSEL: NCT00687986). 58 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (31 to SABR and 27 to surgery). Median follow-up was 40·2 months (IQR 23·0-47·3) for the SABR group and 35·4 months (18·9-40·7) for the surgery group. Six patients in the surgery group died compared with one patient in the SABR group. Estimated overall survival at 3 years was 95% (95% CI 85-100) in the SABR group compared with 79% (64-97) in the surgery group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·14 [95% CI 0·017-1·190], log-rank p=0·037). Recurrence-free survival at 3 years was 86% (95% CI 74-100) in the SABR group and 80% (65-97) in the surgery group (HR 0·69 [95% CI 0·21-2·29], log-rank p=0·54). In the surgery group, one patient had regional nodal recurrence and two had distant metastases; in the SABR group, one patient had local recurrence, four had regional nodal recurrence, and one had distant metastases. Three (10%) patients in the SABR group had grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (three [10%] chest wall pain, two [6%] dyspnoea or cough, and one [3%] fatigue and rib fracture). No patients given SABR had grade 4 events or treatment-related death. In the surgery group, one (4%) patient died of surgical complications and 12 (44%) patients had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events. Grade 3 events occurring in more than one patient in the surgery group were dyspnoea (four [15%] patients), chest pain (four [15%] patients), and lung infections (two [7%]). SABR could be an option for treating operable stage I NSCLC. Because of the small patient sample size and short follow-up, additional randomised studies comparing SABR with surgery in operable patients are warranted.

59	Stereotactic body radiation therapy for inoperable early stage lung cancer.	2010	Patients with early stage but medically inoperable lung cancer have a poor rate of primary tumor control (30%-40%) and a high rate of mortality (3-year survival, 20%-35%) with current management. To evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy in a high-risk population of patients with early stage but medically inoperable lung cancer. Phase 2 North American multicenter study of patients aged 18 years or older with biopsy-proven peripheral T1-T2N0M0 non-small cell tumors (measuring <5 cm in diameter) and medical conditions precluding surgical treatment. The prescription dose was 18 Gy per fraction x 3 fractions (54 Gy total) with entire treatment lasting between 1(1/2) and 2 weeks. The study opened May 26, 2004, and closed October 13, 2006; data were analyzed through August 31, 2009. The primary end point was 2-year actuarial primary tumor control; secondary end points were disease-free survival (ie, primary tumor, involved lobe, regional, and disseminated recurrence), treatment-related toxicity, and overall survival. A total of 59 patients accrued, of which 55 were evaluable (44 patients with T1 tumors and 11 patients with T2 tumors) with a median follow-up of 34.4 months (range, 4.8-49.9 months). Only 1 patient had a primary tumor failure; the estimated 3-year primary tumor control rate was 97.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.3%-99.7%). Three patients had recurrence within the involved lobe; the 3-year primary tumor and involved lobe (local) control rate was 90.6% (95% CI, 76.0%-96.5%). Two patients experienced regional failure; the local-regional control rate was 87.2% (95% CI, 71.0%-94.7%). Eleven patients experienced disseminated recurrence; the 3-year rate of disseminated failure was 22.1% (95% CI, 12.3%-37.8%). The rates for disease-free survival and overall survival at 3 years were 48.3% (95% CI, 34.4%-60.8%) and 55.8% (95% CI, 41.6%-67.9%), respectively. The median overall survival was 48.1 months (95% CI, 29.6 months to not reached). Protocol-specified treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reported in 7 patients (12.7%; 95% CI, 9.6%-15.8%); grade 4 adverse events were reported in 2 patients (3.6%; 95% CI, 2.7%-4.5%). No grade 5 adverse events were reported. Patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy had a survival rate of 55.8% at 3 years, high rates of local tumor control, and moderate treatment-related morbidity.

60	Postoperative Radiation Therapy Is Associated With Improved Overall Survival in Incompletely Resected Stage II and III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.	2016	To review trends in the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for stage II and III incompletely resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and evaluate the association between PORT and survival in such patients. We identified patients with pathologic stage N0-2, overall American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II or III NSCLC within the National Cancer Data Base who had undergone a lobectomy or pneumonectomy with positive surgical margins. Only patients coded as receiving external-beam PORT at 50 to 74 Gy or observation were included. To account for perioperative mortality, we excluded patients who survived less than 4 months after diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with PORT receipt. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for multivariable analyses of overall survival. Among 3,395 included patients, 1,207 (35.6%) received PORT. Predictors for the use of PORT among this patient population included age less than 60 years, treatment in a nonacademic facility, earlier year of diagnosis, decreased travel distance, lower nodal stage, and chemotherapy receipt. On multivariable analysis adjusting for demographic and clinicopathologic covariates, PORT (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70 to 092) was associated with improved survival. Subset analysis by nodal stage showed that PORT improved survival across all nodal stages. PORT is associated with improved overall survival in patients with incompletely resected stage II or III N0-2 NSCLC. The use of PORT for this population in more recent years has been declining. In the absence of randomized trials evaluating PORT utilization for this patient population, our findings strongly support the delivery of PORT in patients with incompletely resected NSCLC.
